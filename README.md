# PersonalServURbit
This repository is the documentation of my personal server journey for the end goal of running a self-hosted and highly capable urbit (see urbit.org for more if you are curious).

### Component Parts
1. Smol computer (rPi4) running Ubuntu
2. Urbit planet on said smol computer
3. BTC node
4. electrum instance
5. BTC provider agent
6. BTC wallet
7. Lightning Node

### Goals
- Be able to run my own instance of the Bitcoin blockchain
- connect mobile lightning wallet to personally owned Lightning node
- Use Minio to run S3 buckets locally for use with Urbit
- encrypt at rest, if possible.
- Be able to SSH into rPi from remote locations
- be able to access Urbit using Tailscale
- Digital Sovereignty

### Related Guides and skills
Tentative list of guides that I have heard exist and need to compile, review, understand, and adapt:
- Minio for S3 Buckets
- Bitcoind setup
- elect.rs setup
- bitcoin provider setup
- bitcoin wallet setup
- urbit.org documentation
- understanding SSH
- Smol Computer guide
- detaching and reattaching terminal screens
- and any number of things I will continue to add to this list.
